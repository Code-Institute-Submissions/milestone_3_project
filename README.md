All code was written on Github using a newly created repository.





### Updates

Code was tested through the GitPod platform by entering 'python3 -m http.server' into the console or by clicking
the windown icon in the right hand corner for a in-window view of page code representation.

Using GitHub, HTML, CSS. JavaScript and additional resources were updated via the below process:

In the Command line enter: 
```
git Status
```
To give you the names of which files have been modified and require following the below process.
```
git add (insert appropriate file path here e.g index.html)
```
```
git commit -m '(insert description of update e.g Font style updated to ...)'
```
```
git push  
```

and all changes will be pushed to the repository.  

## Forking the GitHub Repository 

Forking the GitHub Repository creates a copy of the original where another person is able to view and /or make changes without affecting the original repository.  This can be completed through the following steps:

* Log into GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
* At the top of the Repository locate the "Fork" button.
* Clicking this button will now create a copy of the original repository in one's own GitHub account.

## Local Clone 

If a person wished to make a local clone, the following steps should be followed:

* Log into GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository.
* Under the repository name, click "Clone or Download"
* To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS" copy this link.
* Open Git Bash
* Change the current working directory to the location upon which you want the cloned directory to be made.
* Type 'git clone', and then paste the URL previously copied e.g:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-Repository
```
* Press enter and your local clone will be created.
