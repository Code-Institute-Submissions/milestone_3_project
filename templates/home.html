        <ul>
            <li>Almost 10% of all children and young people in the UK – more than 1.4 million - have speech, language and communication needs (SLCN) (ICAN)</li>
            <li>The challenge is even greater in deprived areas, where more than 50% of children have delayed language. 
            A lack of knowledge and resources means that too many children and young people with SLCN don’t receive enough appropriate support. 
            This affects their educational outcomes, their employability and their health and wellbeing. (ICAN)</li>
            <li>50-90% of children with persistent speech, language and communication difficulties go on to have reading difficulties
            At least 60% of young people in young offender institutions have communication difficulties (Communication Trust)</li>
            <li>Children with speech, language communication needs (SLCN) are at high risk of difficulties with reading, writing and spelling. 
            If children can't say words, 
            they will be more likely to have difficulties in 'sounding out' words for reading and spelling, or writing them down. 
            If they can't understand the words they hear, they will struggle to understand what they have read.  
            Children with communication difficulties are more likely to have behaviour difficulties. 
            Many children with identified behaviour needs have previously unidentified SLCN. 
            Imagine the frustration of not getting your message across. (Communication Trust)</li>
